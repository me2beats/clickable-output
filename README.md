# clickable-output
Allows to open gdscript scripts in Godot ScriptEditor when clicking on their paths in Output.

Implemented in a hacky and ugly way


# Installation
As a usual Godot plugin: add clickable-output folder to res://addons then enable the plugin in ProjectSettings

# Known issues and limitations:
1. The plugin doesn't work correctly if there are long lines in the `Output` text.
2. Script paths don't become underlined/highlighted when hovering.
